Planning corporate events in Dubai or across the Middle East during Ramadan requires not only precision but also deep cultural understanding. As a destination management company with over 35 years of experience, Global Event Management has mastered the art of seamless event logistics, especially during the holy month. Ramadan 2026 UAE working hours will influence business operations, making it essential for event organizers to adapt their strategies for successful, respectful, and memorable gatherings.

## Understanding Ramadan Working Hours and Their Impact in the UAE and Middle East

Ramadan is a time of reflection, fasting, and community, observed with great reverence throughout the UAE and the wider MENA region. During this period, the UAE government announces reduced working hours for both public and private sectors. Typically, workdays shorten by two hours, and many businesses adjust their schedules to support employees’ spiritual and physical well-being.

**Key considerations for Middle East event planning during Ramadan 2026:**
- **Shortened business hours:** Most offices and venues operate on reduced schedules across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and other MENA countries.
- **Evening-focused activities:** Corporate events, incentive travel, and luxury group experiences are often planned after sunset to coincide with Iftar, the evening meal breaking the fast.
